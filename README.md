# Wokba
Wokba is an Android App which I designed and implemented during Internship at Aohey LLC. 
This app is dedicated to promotion and delivery of home made Chinese Delicious food. 
Developed Functionality includes:
1. Register, Sign Up(includes "forgot password")
2. MapView of all Chinese food spots(implemented through Google Map API), including a small infoWindow when onClick.
3. ListView of all Chinese food spots.
4. Bind Credit Card or Debit Card and make payments(implemented through stripe API).
5. Online Ordering and customized options made on each order(like double cheese, more beef etc.)
6. Order status track.
7. "Shake Shake" function.
