# Wokba
Wokba is an Android App which I designed and implemented during Internship at Aohey LLC. 
This app is dedicated to promotion and delivery of home made Chinese Delicious food. 
Developed Functionality includes:
- Register, Sign Up(includes "forgot password")
- MapView of all Chinese food spots(implemented through Google Map API), including a small infoWindow when onClick.
- ListView of all Chinese food spots.
- Bind Credit Card or Debit Card and make payments(implemented through stripe API).
- Online Ordering and customized options made on each order(like double cheese, more beef etc.)
- Order status track.
- "Shake Shake" function.
